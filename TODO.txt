CODE STRUCTURE 1
----------------
Get refresh token errors and id token parsing reporting properly
Do this using mainviewmodelevents in authenticatedfragmentviewmodel

CODE STRUCTURE 2
----------------
Move code from mainactivity to unauthenticated and authenticated fragments

ERRORS
------
Briefly dicuss OAuth error responses in the write up

FIXES
-----
Logs output registration response instead of message???
Logout only works sometimes

UI / POLISH
-----------
Refinements a little in line with iOS HAAPI sample and better use of colours
Display details about valid access tokens as well as id tokens
Clean up dependencies

SECURITY
--------
Discuss with Jacob whether to use Authenticated DCR
Separate implicit flow client to get a DCR token will create inconsistent code
HAAPI and old device versions mentioned by Daniel

ARTICLES
--------
Mention most mainstream coding style is single activity
Mention multiple ways to code an Android app and solution can be adapted - eg official samples transfer between activities
Mention how a prerequisite is to create a test user
Show AuthState class code snippet
Mention WebAuthn after Password Autofill
