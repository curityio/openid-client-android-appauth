--------------------------

Leads to simplest code - a few simple fragments
AppAuth examples use old style navigation which makes the OAuth harder to follow
Simpler code makes handling of errors a bit simpler
Multiple ways to code an Android app and solution can be adapted

FEEDBACK
--------
Daniel: HAAPI and old device versions feature switch
Daniel: Authenticated DCR should use implicit flow but creates a messy sample
