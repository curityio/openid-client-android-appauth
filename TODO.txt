ISSUES
------
Errors higher up as suggested from Urban
UI refinements as suggested by Urban

Logout only works intermittently - understand this better and compare to Cognito
Use my custom Cognito logout code

TESTING
-------
Run on device
Run on old emulator

FINALIZING
----------
Get DCR token with a client secret working via curl and add sections on this
Add sections on development log output, for educational purposes only

FEEDBACK
--------
Daniel: would like guidance on HAAPI and old device versions feature switch
Daniel: Authenticated DCR should use implicit flow but creates a messy sample
Jacob: Demonstrate authenticated DCR via Client Credentials curl request and say more about it
Travis: I would only use Claimed HTTPS Schemes with AppAuth
