POLISH
------
Use welcome image from HAAPI sample
use getString for subject / access token / refresh token strings.xml
Better presented labels and values in line with HAAPI iOS

BUGS
----
Clear error on retry
Logout only works intermittently - see if disposing custom tab makes a difference
ApplicationStateManager thread safety

SECURITY
--------
DCR token with a client secret

JUSTIFICATION
-------------
Good mobile samples have high value in terms of customers and readers
Mention most mainstream coding style is single activity
Leads to simplest code - a few simple fragments
AppAuth examples use old style navigation which makes the OAuth harder to follow
Simpler code makes error handling easier to implement reliably
Multiple ways to code an Android app and solution can be adapted
View model means no manual getting and setting of controls

FEEDBACK
--------
Daniel: HAAPI and old device versions feature switch
Daniel: Authenticated DCR should use implicit flow but creates a messy sample
