BUGS
----
Need to store error in parent view model and then use it in child view model
Clear errors for next operation
Logout only works sometimes

POLISH
------
Text labels for subject / access token / refresh token to strings.xml
Better presented labels and values as for HAAPI iOS
Use image from HAAPI sample

SECURITY
--------
DCR token with a client secret

JUSTIFICATION
-------------
Good mobile samples have high value in terms of customers and readers
Mention most mainstream coding style is single activity
Leads to simplest code - a few simple fragments
AppAuth examples use old style navigation which makes the OAuth harder to follow
Simpler code makes error handling easier to implement reliably
Multiple ways to code an Android app and solution can be adapted

FEEDBACK
--------
Daniel: HAAPI and old device versions feature switch
Daniel: Authenticated DCR should use implicit flow but creates a messy sample
